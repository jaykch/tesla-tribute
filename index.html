                Nikola Tesla (10 July 1856 â€“ 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer,
                mechanical engineer, physicist, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the
                modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.

            <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><em>1856: </em></strong>Born in Smiljan, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His
                        parents were ethnic Serbians.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong><em>1875: </em></strong>Enrolled at Austrian Polytechnic. He Claimed to have graduated,
                        but the institution disagrees.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong><em>1882: </em></strong>Worked for Continental Edison.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong><em>1882: </em></strong>Identified Magnetic Induction Field Principle.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong><em>1884: </em></strong>Moved to United States.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong><em>1885: </em></strong>After Edison refused to pay, Tesla quit working for Edison, with
                        the plan and intention of starting his own electrical company.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong><em>1886: </em></strong>Began Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong><em>1887: </em></strong>The War of Currents began in 1887. Direct current, invented and
                        supported by Edison, was in direct competition with Tesla's alternating current.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong><em>1891: </em></strong>Patented Tesla Coil.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong><em>1891: </em></strong>With the support of the Westinghouse Company, Tesla's
                        alternating current powered the World's Columbian Exhibition.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong><em>1901: </em></strong>Construction on Wardenclyffe Tower Began. Tesla believed that he
                        could transmit electrical energy over long distances wirelessly, and the tower would illustrate
                        that. The project was never fully completed.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong><em>1915: </em></strong>Files Suit Against Guglielmo Marconi. Marconi is typically
                        credited with radio transmission; however, Tesla accomplished this before Marconi.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong><em>1934: </em></strong>The New York Times published Tesla's particle beam research.
                        While he was not financially successful, he continued to be a relatively prominent voice in the
                        scientific community.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong><em>1943: </em></strong>Nikola Tesla died in the hotel he made his home. Upon his death,
                        the U.S. government immediately seized his papers and research.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong><em>1960: </em></strong>the scientific community recognized Tesla's achievements by
                        defining Tesla as a unit of measurement. Tesla is a unit of magnetic field B.
